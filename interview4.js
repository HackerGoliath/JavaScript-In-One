/* Why Functions?
DRY - Do Not Repeat Yourself
You can reuse code: Define the code once and use it many times.
You can use the same code many times with diferent arguements to produce different results

OR

A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. 
This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again
